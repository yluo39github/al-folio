I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer & Information Science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Northeastern University under the supervision of [Xiaolin Xu](https://www.xiaolinxu.com/).

**<span style="color:#005A43;">I'm looking for self-motivated students starting in Spring 2025</span>**, with strong research interests in one or more concentrations in security (including both hardware-oriented security and cybersecurity), machine learning, database management system design, operating systems, computer architecture, or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

If you are interested, please read this [**<span style="color:#005A43;">instruction</span>**](./recruiting_ads) first.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
